Description
-----------
	The spam checker program identifies whether a file containing emails are span or not spam. The program reads in a file, and the user interacts with the program. It prompts the user to enter an email, then it returns whether the email is spam or not spam.


How to compile
--------------
	To compile this program, first go to the directory containing the spamFilter. Use command <cd pa1> (note: excluding the left/right arrows) to navigate to the directory containing the spamFilter. Then type make to compile all the files in the directory. The makefile creates an executable called spamfilter. If you want to compile individual files, enter make <name_of_file>. The makefile will create an executable with the name of the file.

How to run
----------
To run the program, type the executable name and any arguments that go after the executable. The generic executable provided: ./a.out. Simple type ./a.out into the terminal, along with any arguments that should go after the exectuable.
